## Enforcement Responsibilities

As an individual maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

I reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will explain the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within the project and when
an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.
Examples of representing the project include using the project's official email address,
posting via the project's official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

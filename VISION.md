# VISION

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this requirements document is to outline the necessary features, functionality, and specifications for the Nostr Implementation Possibilities (NIPs) monorepo. This document will serve as a reference for contributors, developers, and users who are interested in understanding the scope of the project, its goals, and the expectations for implementing and interacting with the monorepo.

By providing clear and comprehensive requirements, we aim to facilitate effective collaboration, efficient development, and a consistent understanding of the project among all stakeholders. This document will guide the design, implementation, and maintenance of the monorepo to ensure it meets the needs of the Nostr community and adheres to the principles outlined in the NIPs.

### Scope

This requirements document focuses on the development of the go-nostr software, a Nostr-compatible implementation that includes both relay and client functionalities. The software will provide the necessary features and tools for developers and users to interact with the Nostr protocol, allowing for the creation and management of events, as well as communication between clients and relays. The go-nostr software aims to streamline the development of Nostr-compatible applications, promote the adoption of the Nostr network, and support the growth of the decentralized social platform. While not covering the implementation of every single NIP, it will focus on core functionalities and selected NIPs that are essential for a functional and robust Nostr system.

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this requirements document is to outline the necessary features, functionality, and specifications for the Nostr Implementation Possibilities (NIPs) monorepo. This document will serve as a reference for contributors, developers, and users who are interested in understanding the scope of the project, its goals, and the expectations for implementing and interacting with the monorepo.

By providing clear and comprehensive requirements, we aim to facilitate effective collaboration, efficient development, and a consistent understanding of the project among all stakeholders. This document will guide the design, implementation, and maintenance of the monorepo to ensure it meets the needs of the Nostr community and adheres to the principles outlined in the NIPs.
